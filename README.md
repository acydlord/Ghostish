Ghostish
=======

A theme for the [Ghost Blogging platform](http://ghost.org "Ghost Blogging Platform") that makes the front end look just like the back end post editor but with a bit of a twist.

Design copyright 2013 Ghost Foundation.

Forked from Casper, the default Ghost theme and forked again from GhostBacker, polygonix's theme.

##Changes from GhostBacker

* List style display on index
* Tiny UI display and linkage(?) tweaks
* a:hover's don't underline, they change opacity to 0.7
* Larger display size, possibly too large for most people
* Better layout Media Queries for the Responsiveness
